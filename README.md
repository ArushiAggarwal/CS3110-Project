Overview:
This project is a game inspired by Mastermind, a code cracking game between two 
players, where one player assumes the role of the code maker, and the other the 
code breaker. The code breaker guesses 4-digit codes that the code maker creates 
using keys, while providing feedback, until the code is guessed. The 
player plays against the computer using a graphical user interface that they 
navigate using keyboard keys. If the player is the code maker, then they create 
a code and the computer will guess for a limited number of tries. If the player 
is a code breaker, the computer generates a code by which the player must guess.
Feedback is similar to the game Wordle, however positions are not revealed, thus
the game involves a lot of strategy and logic.
