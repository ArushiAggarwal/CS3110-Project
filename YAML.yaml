This project is a game inspired by Mastermind, a code cracking game between two 
players, where one player assumes the role of the code maker, and the other the 
code breaker. The code breaker guesses codes that the code maker creates uses 
keys, while providing ambiguous feedback, until the code is guessed. The player 
plays from the terminal against the computer. If the player is a code maker, 
then they create a code and the computer will guess for a limited number of 
tries. If the player is a code breaker, the computer generates a code by which 
the player must guess. The algorithms are heavily inspired by Bayesian 
inference, hashing, pseudorandomness, and game theory.
